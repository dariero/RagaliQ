    name: Python list methods
    query: How do I add an item to a list in Python?
    context:
      - "Python lists have several methods for adding items: append() adds to end, insert() adds at position, extend() adds multiple items."
      - "The append() method takes a single argument and adds it to the end of the list."
    response: "You can add an item to a Python list using the append() method. For example: my_list.append('new_item')."
    expected_answer: Use the append() method to add items to a list.
    expected_facts:
      - append() method adds items to list
      - append() adds to the end of the list

    name: RAG system components
    query: What are the main components of a RAG system?
    context:
      - "A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system consists of three main components: a retriever that fetches relevant documents, a document store that holds the knowledge base, and a generator (LLM) that produces responses."
      - The retriever typically uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents.
    response: "A RAG system has three main components: retriever, document store, and generator (LLM). The retriever fetches relevant documents using vector embeddings, the document store maintains the knowledge base, and the generator produces the final response."
    expected_facts:
      - RAG has three components
      - retriever fetches documents
      - document store holds knowledge
      - generator produces responses
